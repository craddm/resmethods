# Different types of file

Data comes in many different shapes, sizes, and formats.

The most common file formats you'll deal with are either Excel files or text files, but you may also find dealing with SPSS files useful.

Fortunately, R has several functions and packages for importing data!

|File formats| File extension| Functions| Package|
|-|-|-|-|
|SPSS  | .sav| **read_sav()**| library(haven)|
|Excel | .xls, .xlsx|**read_excel()**|library(readxl)|
|Text  | .csv, .txt, .* |**read_csv()**, **read_delim()**|library(readr)|

# Fear of Crime Dataset

[Ellis & Renouf (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14789949.2017.1410562) - the relationship between fear of crime and various personality measures.

Their data is openly available, stored as text in a *comma-separated-values* format (*.csv*).

Once again, we can use the import button or some code (with **read_csv()**) to load this data in and automatically format it into a *tibble*.

```{r foc-dataset, eval = FALSE}
library(readr)
FearofCrime <- read_csv("data/FearofCrime.CSV")
```

# Fear of Crime Dataset

Ellis & Renouf (2018) collected data online using Qualtrics.

The file contains one column for each question that the participants answered, for a total of 169(!) columns.

Each row is a single participant's answers, and their demographic information.

```{r}
FearofCrime
```

# Prison population 

Last week, we looked at some data regarding the UK's prison population.

The data is contained in an [Excel spreadsheet](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/676248/prison-population-data-tool-31-december-2017.xlsx), downloaded from [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk).

```{r read-pris, eval = FALSE}
library(readxl)
prison_pop <- read_excel("data/prison-population-data-tool-31-december-2017.xlsx",
                         sheet = "PT Data")
```

We use the **read_excel()** function to read Excel files.

Note how the file name and location come first, and then I specify a specific *sheet*.

Excel spreadsheets often have multiple sheets with different information.

# Prison population

Once the data is imported, we have a *tibble*.

We can immediately see there are 6 columns with 22409 rows.

```{r}
prison_pop
```

We need to do more work to make this file useable...

# Data transformation

With datasets like those we've loaded, there are often organisational issues. 

For example, there could be many columns or rows we don't need, or the data would make more sense if it were sorted.

This is where **dplyr** comes in!

|Function |Effect|
|------------|----|
| select()   |Include or exclude variables (columns)|
| arrange()  |Change the order of observations (rows)|
| filter()   |Include or exclude observations (rows)|
| mutate()   |Create new variables (columns)|
| group_by() |Create groups of observations|
| summarise()|Aggregate or summarise groups of observations (rows)|

# Summarising rows

.pull-left[
A common task when analyzing data is to create summaries of statistical characteristics.

Here I calculate the *mean*, *standard deviation*, and *variance* of the State Anxiety variable. 

Other possible summmary functions (other than **mean()**, **sd()**, or **var()**) include **max()**, **min()**, **IQR()**, or **median()**.
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
summarise(crime,
          mean = mean(SA),
          standard_dev = sd(SA),

# Summarising groups

Once data is *grouped*, the most common thing to do is to **summarise()** those groups.

```{r}
summarise(grouped_crime,
          state_anxiety = mean(SA),
          sd_SA = sd(SA),
          var_SA = var(SA))

# Filtering rows

The `prison_pop` dataset has 22409 rows, but we don't need (or want) them all!

```{r}
unique(prison_pop$View)
```

The data is actually *repeated* four times, but organised differently each time.

```{r echo = FALSE}
prison_pop %>%
  group_by(View) %>%
  summarise(total_pop = sum(Population, na.rm = TRUE),
            num_entries = n())

If we just started investigating the data without accounting for this, it would be misleading.

.pull-left[
```{r warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(prison_pop, aes(x = Population)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(prison_pop, aes(x = Population)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100) + facet_wrap(~View)
```

# Filtering rows

We can use the **filter()** function to select only the rows we're interested in, using *logical conditions* and *relational operators*.

```{r filter-pris}
filter(prison_pop,
       View == "a Establishment*Sex*Age Group")
```

---
# Relational operators

Relational operators compare two (or more) things and return a **logical** value (i.e. TRUE/FALSE)

|Operator|Meaning| Example|
|---|------------------| |
|>  | Greater than    |5 > 4|
|>= | Greater than or equal to| 4 >= 4|
|<  | Less than | Population < 400|
|<= | Less than or equal to | Population <= 400|
|== | Exactly equal to | Sex == "Male"| 
|!= | Not equal to | Establishment != "Ashfield"|
|%in%| Is contained in| Establishment %in% c("Bedford", "Oakwood")|

---
# Logical operators

Logical operators can be used to combine multiple relational operators or *negate* a relational operator.

|Operator| Meaning| Example|
|-|-|-|-|
|&| AND| Population < 1000 & Sex == "Male"|
|&#124;| OR| Population > 200 &vert; Population < 500|
|!| NOT| !(Establishment %in% c("Bedford", "Oakwood")) |

background-position: 90% 5%

# Filtering rows

We can have multiple *conditions* for selection with **filter()**.

Suppose we only wanted to include rows where Population is over 300 but under 600.

```{r filter-pris-two}
filter(prison_pop,
       View == "a Establishment*Sex*Age Group",
       Population > 300 & Population < 600)
```

# Pipes

Often you want to conduct several steps, one after the other. 

You could do this using objects to store each intermediate step.
```{r}
temp_pris <- filter(prison_pop,
                    View == "a Establishment*Sex*Age Group",
                    Date == "2015-06")
temp_pris <- group_by(temp_pris,
                      Sex,
                      `Age / Custody / Nationality / Offence Group`)
temp_pris <- summarise(temp_pris,
                       mean_pop = mean(Population, na.rm = TRUE), 
                       median_pop = median(Population, na.rm = TRUE),
                       total_pop = sum(Population, na.rm = TRUE),
                       max_pop = max(Population, na.rm = TRUE))
```
---
background-image: url(images/05/dplyr-logo.png)

background-position: 90% 5%

# Pipes

A simpler way is to use *pipes* (**%>%**)

*pipes* can be read as meaning "AND THEN"

```{r}
prison_pop %>%
  filter(View == "a Establishment*Sex*Age Group",
         Date == "2015-06") %>%
  group_by(Sex, `Age / Custody / Nationality / Offence Group`) %>%
  summarise(mean_pop = mean(Population, na.rm = TRUE), 
            median_pop = median(Population, na.rm = TRUE),
            total_pop = sum(Population, na.rm = TRUE),
            max_pop = max(Population, na.rm = TRUE))
```
