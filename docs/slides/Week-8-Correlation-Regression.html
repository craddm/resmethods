# Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST)

.large[
Think back to our previous questions:

1.  Do men and women differ in terms of their fear of crime?

2.  Are people who have been a victim of crime more fearful of crime?

The basis of NHST is to phrase these questions as: 

If there is only one population, how likely is it that our two samples have values this different from each other?

The tilde (~) symbol in R usually means "modelled by" 

`FoC ~ victim_crime` means `FoC modelled by victim_crime`.

`data = crime` tells R to look in the `crime` data frame for the data.

`paired = FALSE` tells R that this is an *independent samples* test.

How do we quantify the relationship between these variables?

# The mean and the variance

As you can see, the values don't lie directly on the mean, but are spread around it.

To quantify how much the values vary from the mean, we can calculate the *variance*.

Here's the scary looking formula for the variance:

$$  \sigma^2 = \frac{\sum(x - \bar{x})^2}{N - 1} $$

And here's the not-so-scary R function:

# Correlation and covariance

Now let's look at these previous two plots as differences from their respective means.

What we want to now is to what extent the values *vary together*. I.e. as one goes up, does the other? 

This is *covariance*.

Here's the scary formula:

$$ cov(x, y) = \frac{\sum((x - \bar{x})(y - \bar{y}))}{N - 1} $$

Here's the not-so-scary R function:


```r

# Correlation and covariance

.pull-left[
Covariance gives us a measure of how much two variables vary together. 

But the numbers it gives us can be hard to interpret when the variables are on very different scales.

So we rescale the covariance using the standard deviations of each variable.

$$ corr(x, y) = r = \frac{cov(x, y)}{\sigma^x\sigma^y} $$

This gives us the *correlation coefficient*, or *r*.

cor(crime$E, crime$FoC)

# Reporting a correlation

.large[
Reporting a correlation is pretty straightforward. Only the correlation coefficient and p-value are typically required. e.g. 

"There was a significant positive correlation between emotionality and fear of crime, *r* = .37, *p* &lt; .001."

However, it's best to also specify which type of correlation you used (e.g. Pearson's or Spearman's); and a scatterplot showing the relationship should almost always be shown. Typically, the degrees of freedom or number of observations should also be given, e.g. *r*(299) = .37, *p* &lt; .001, or *r* = .37, *p* &lt; .001, *N* = 301.

Note that *r* is considered a measure of *effect size*. An *r* of .1 is considered a small effect, while an *r* of .8 is considered a large effect.

Correlation quantifies the *strength* and *direction* of an association between two continuous variables.

But what if we want to *predict* the values of one variable from those of another?

For example, as Emotionality increases, *how much* does Fear of Crime change?

  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +

The line added to this scatterplot is the *line of best fit*.

It's the straight line that gets closest to going through all of the points on the plot.

But how do we work out where the line should be? 
]
]

---
# The line of best fit 

The line represents the predicted value of **y** at each value of **x**.

The prediction is made using the following formula:

`\(y = a + bX\)`

*a* is the *intercept* - the point where the line would cross the y-axis when the value of the x-axis is 0.

*b* is the *slope* - the steepness and direction of the line.

The *line of best fit* can be found by adjusting the *intercept* and *slope* to minimise the *sum of squared residuals*.

# Fear of crime predicted by emotionality

Let's focus on the coefficients.


```r
summary(foc_by_E)$coefficients
```

```
##              Estimate Std. Error  t value     Pr(&gt;|t|)
## (Intercept) 0.6491774 0.26621482 2.438547 1.532835e-02
## E           0.5474598 0.07952319 6.884279 3.421376e-11
```

Estimate is the *coefficient* of each predictor; Std. Error is an estimate of the accuracy of that coefficient.

The significance of each predictor is tested using a t-test; *t value* is the t statistic, and the *Pr(&gt;|t|)* column is the p-value.

Thus, *Emotionality* is a significant predictor of *Fear of Crime*. 

Since its coefficient is positive, Fear of Crime increases as Emotionality increases. 

---
# Fear of crime predicted by emotionality
.pull-left[
Again, the regression line is described by the formula `\(y = a + bX\)`. So we can fill that out with our model coefficients as follows:

Fear of crime = 0.65 + 0.55 * `\(X\)`

`\(X\)` is the value of the *predictor*.

The *intercept* is now the value of `\(y\)` when the value of the predictor is *zero*.

The coefficient for the predictor is the amount that `\(y\)` increases for each 1 unit increase in the predictor.

R-squared ( `\(R^2\)` ) is a measure of model fit. Specifically, it's the proportion of *explained* variance in the data.

We previously looked at the *variance* around the *mean*.

After linear regression, we look at how much reality differs from the model predictions - the *residual error*.

To work out how well our model fits, we first need to know how much *total variation* there is in the data.

For that, we sum the squared differences of the values of the dependent variable `\(y\)` from the mean of the dependent variable `\(\bar{y}\)` - the *total sum of squares*, `\(SS_t\)`:

`\(SS_t = \sum(y - \bar{y})^2\)`

Why square the differences?

1.  Negative values become positive. 

2.  Values that are further away from the mean often get even further away.

This prevents "errors" from cancelling out, and effectively penalises values that are far away from the mean.

We then calculate the sum of the squared differences of the values of the dependent variable ( `\(y\)` ) from the model predictions - the sum of the squared residuals, `\(SS_r\)`:

`\(SS_r = \sum(y - \hat{y})^2\)`

# Model fit

.large[
Finally, we calculate *model sum of squares* - `\(SS_m\)` - as the difference between the *total sum of squares* and the *residual sum of squares*. This tells us, roughly, how much better our model is than just using the *mean*:

`\(SS_m = SS_t - SS_r\)`

R-squared ( `\(R^2\)` ) can then be calculated by dividing the model sum of squares by the total sum of squares:

`\(R^2 = \frac{SS_m}{SS_t}\)`

This yields the *percentage of variance explained by the model*. 

This is a long-winded way of saying: Higher `\(R^2\)` means more explained variance, and thus, a better fitting model.

## [1] 0.1368193
```

Our simple regression model of the effect of Emotionality on Fear of Crime explained ~ 14% of the variance.

What's left?

1. Other variables? 

2. Measurement error?

# Example of reporting a simple regression model

.large[
"Simple linear regression was used to investigate the relationship between emotionality and fear of crime. A significant regression equation was found that explained 14% of the variance, `\(R^2\)` = .14, *F*(1, 299) = 47.39, *p* &lt; .001. Fear of crime increased significantly with increases in Emotionality, `\(b\)` = 0.55, *t*(299) = 6.884, *p* &lt; .001."

# Next week

Next week we'll continue with **regression**, looking at multiple predictors.

We'll also begin with **one-way ANOVA** for comparison of multiple means.
